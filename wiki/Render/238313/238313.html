<div class="wikidoc"><h2>NDB Write Issues</h2>
The list of work items here keeps growing. Currently on my mind:
<ul><li>A &quot;virtual<i>ref</i>tracker&quot; class to handle refs in memory; so we can flush pending amap frees without worrying about deleting data from under an open node somewhere (although we still won&#39;t be able to flush pending amaps frees if there is an open context, anywhere, except the one requested the flush).</li>
<li>Speaking of which, an amap abstraction is long overdue.</li>
<li>db_contexts will be hierarchtical, you can open a context from inside a context. Commits &quot;merge&quot; the commting context into its parent. The &quot;root context&quot; is special, commiting to it hits the disk. You never have to explicitly commit the root context (...or do you? or should it happen on idle?)</li>
<li>non-root contextx have nbt/bbt root pages saved at the position they were opened in, but they are never updated. instead they have seperate std::maps with &quot;diffs&quot; of the changes to the nodes and a std::map of the new blocks created, along with a std::vector of nodes deleted. db_context commits are going to be complicated...</li></ul></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
