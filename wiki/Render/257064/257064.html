<div class="wikidoc"><h1>Big Picture Issues</h1><ul><li>Write support. I&#39;m currently working on building support, starting in the NDB level. The write support has to respect the immutability of blocks and pages at the NDB level, yet be intuitive at a higher level.</li>
<li>GCC v4.4 support on other platforms</li>
<li>Test suite expansion/rewrite. I want to use Boost.Unit, but I don&#39;t want to take a link dependancy on anything.</li>
<li>Additional sample programs</li>
<li>Test GCC v4.5 as a fully supported compiler on multiple platforms</li>
<li>Test GCC v4.3 and v4.2 as partially supported compilers on multiple platforms</li></ul></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
