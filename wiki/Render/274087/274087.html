<div class="wikidoc"><h2>Cross Platform Issues</h2>
Working once again. At least GCC 4.4.1 on Windows (MinGW). Ideally I&#39;d like to validate it works truly cross platform.<br /><br />I&#39;ve heard that it compiles in GCC 4.3 on Linux and GCC 4.2 on MacOSX, but the unit tests do not pass.</div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
