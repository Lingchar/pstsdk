    "Html": "<p>Hi. I have started to tackle writing an msg file from a message object. I have had some success as long as the message does not have an embedded object. I think the problem is I currently write an empty __nameid_version1.0 sub-storage stream to the msg file. I understand the concept of the named property mapping table but I am not sure how to go about creating the msg nameid storage stream. Any ideas or direction?</p>\n<p>As an example my message object for a particular entryid has a property with a property id of 0x8360. Using mfcmapi to view the properties on the same msg created indicates 0x8360 should be mapped to 0x801C.&nbsp;Is there an API that allows me to map back and forth?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>",
