I noticed that the message count returned is 2 while I'm expecting 1. while iterating over these messages I noticed the additional message has subject &quot;LocalFreebusy&quot;, I used a viewer other than MS-Outlook and I noticed it is a message object located in a folder called &quot;FreeBusy Data&quot; and is considered as a message object but it has no body(neither RTF nor HTML nor Plain text).\r<br />\n<br />\nMy question is, how to exclude this item from count? I tried a trivial solution to exclude it by subject comparing, but I may have a real email subjected with the same name in other folders!!\r<br />\ndoes this item has a special type or some special property ??\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance.<br />\n",
