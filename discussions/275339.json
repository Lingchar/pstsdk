If you look at the implementation of this function in nameid.h, you'll see it's pretty simple - because the PST assigns prop_ids sequentially.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You're passing in the an id for a named prop (half of a name_id pair, the other half being a GUID - PS_CONTACTS).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So, you're using the same value two different ways. prop_id_exists takes the \"value\" part of it.
