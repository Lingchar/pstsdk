I even tried 0x6638 which is PR_FOLDER_CHILD_COUNT but this property doesn't exist in property bag.&nbsp;Any idea how to get the correct subfolder count?</p>\r\n<p>here's my code -</p>\r\n<p><span> </span>folder fSub = m_pstStore-&gt;open_folder(nidFolder);<br>for(folder::folder_iterator fIter = fSub.sub_folder_begin(); fIter != fSub.sub_folder_end(); ++fIter)<span> <br></span>{<span> <br></span><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>contentCount = fIter-&gt;get_message_count();<br><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>subfolderCount = fIter-&gt;get_subfolder_count();<br>}&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.</p>",

It's right next to the get_message_count() method too..</p>\r\n<p>The best way to get the subfolder count looks like myfold.get_hierarchy_table().size(), and get_subfolder_count() should be implemented as&nbsp;such. Thanks for reporting the issue!</p>",
